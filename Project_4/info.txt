Fourth and final project of the class. This was a group project (in teams of two) to create a webserver.
Overall, five copies of the program were sent between the two of us (due to COVID-19 work was not done in person together).
One of us focused on research of the webserver and the other on the file serving.
Together the project came together to one file.
